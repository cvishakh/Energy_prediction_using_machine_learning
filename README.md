# Energy_prediction_using_machine_learning
Implementation of a supervised learning procedure with pre- and post-processing steps using the use case of the energy prediction of a machining process.
To perform a regression analysis using the data we have to train different regression models to predict the target variable. In our use case, we want to predict the energy requirement to perform a milling process.
NOTE: You'll need to adjust the .txt file depending on where you have stored the dataset on your PC.
